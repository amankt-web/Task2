# Task2
# Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Before installing React, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org
# Step 2: Install Create React App

Create React App is a tool built by Facebook for quickly setting up React projects. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Create React App globally:
lua
Copy code
npm install -g create-react-app
# Step3: Create a New React Project

Once Create React App is installed, you can create a new React project by running the following command:
lua
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-react-app
Replace my-react-app with your desired project name. This command will create a new directory named my-react-app containing all the necessary files for your React project.

#Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory

After the project is created, navigate to the project directory using the cd command:
bash
Copy code
cd my-react-app

# Step 5: Run the Project

Now that you're inside the project directory, you can start the development server by running the following command:
sql
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the development server and open your default web browser to http://localhost:3000, where you'll see your new React app running.
# Step 6: Explore the Project Structure

Take some time to explore the project structure and familiarize yourself with the files and folders created by Create React App. The main files you'll work with are located in the src directory, particularly App.js, index.js, and index.html.
# Step 7: Make Changes and Experiment

Now that your React project is up and running, you can start making changes to the code in App.js or other files to experiment with React components, JSX syntax, and more. Any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the browser thanks to hot reloading.
That's it! You've successfully installed React, created a new project, and started the development server. Now you can begin building your React application by adding components, styles, and functionality as needed.
